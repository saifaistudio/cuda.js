## 💡 Using cuda.js

Here are some simple examples to get started with cuda.js:

### 🎮 Simple Matrix Multiplication

```javascript
const cuda = require('cuda.js');

const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const b = [5, 6, 7, 8];

const result = cuda.matrixMultiply(a, b);
console.log(result);
```

### 🔍 Data Processing

```javascript
const cuda = require('cuda.js');

const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const processedData = cuda.processData(data);
console.log(processedData);
```
